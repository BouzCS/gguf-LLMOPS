## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**
- Docker 🐳
- Python 3.9 🐍
- Git 🌐

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sql-query-generator.git
   cd sql-query-generator
   ```

2. Build and run the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Access the API at `http://localhost:8000`.

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and deployment. Here's what the pipeline does:

1. **Build**: Builds Docker images for the API and monitoring services.
2. **Test**: Runs unit tests for the API and model.
3. **Scan**: Uses Trivy to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
4. **Deploy**: Deploys the application to production using Docker Compose.

### **Workflow File**
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build Docker images
        run: |
          docker build -t sql-query-generator-api -f Dockerfile.api .
          docker build -t sql-query-generator-monitor -f Dockerfile.monitor .
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          docker run sql-query-generator-api pytest
          docker run sql-query-generator-monitor pytest
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: docker-compose up -d
```

## 🐳 Docker Setup

The project is fully containerized using Docker. Here are the key containers:

- **API**: The FastAPI application.
- **Monitor**: Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
- **Fine-Tune**: A container for fine-tuning the model.

### **Docker Compose**
```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  api:
    image: your-dockerhub-username/sql-query-generator-api
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"

  monitor:
    image: your-dockerhub-username/sql-query-generator-monitor
    ports:
      - "8001:8001"

  finetune:
    image: your-dockerhub-username/sql-query-generator-finetune
    volumes:
      - ./models:/app/models
```

---

## 📊 Monitoring

The project uses **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring:

- **Prometheus**: Collects metrics from the API.
- **Grafana**: Visualizes the metrics in real-time.

### **Access Monitoring**
- Prometheus: `http://localhost:9090`
- Grafana: `http://localhost:3000`

---

## 🧠 Fine-Tuning

To fine-tune the model with new data:

1. Add new data to `data/new_sql_data.csv`.
2. Run the fine-tuning script:
   ```bash
   docker-compose run finetune
   ```

---

## 🚀 Deployment

The project is deployed using **Docker Compose**. To deploy to production:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
